# Word Puzzles
Easy to use software to generate crossword puzzles.
This is still very much alpha software (totally unfinished).  This crossword puzzle generator is provided here for those who would like to kick the tyres and get a preview of some upcoming software.
It uses the [GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English](http://gcide.gnu.org.ua/) as the source for it's english dictionary.
